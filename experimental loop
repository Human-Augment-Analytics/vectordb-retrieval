•	Project
o	VectorDB recall guarantee
o	No resource guarantee (easier to measure, hard to get both guarantees without solving old open problems)
o	First stab:
	Tree with exponentially decaying distances between parents and children
o	Metrics:
	Recall (intersection between true top-k vectors and returned “top-k” vectors)
	Compute-cost (latency)
	Number of vector similarity computations
